## What the UTF

A simple utility to help me out of my ASCII-centric shell

This program just prints out the code points of the string you feed into it. It can also show you the punycode conversion of your string and failure reasons if conversion isn't possible.

Try this
```shell
export PINATA1="pinÃÉata" 
export PINATA2="pi√±ata" 

echo "$PINATA1 has $(echo -n $PINATA1 | wc -c) bytes"
echo "$PINATA2 has $(echo -n $PINATA2 | wc -c) bytes"

if [[ "$PINATA1" != "$PINATA2" ]]
then
    echo 'they do not match!'
fi
```

```
pinÃÉata has        8 bytes
pi√±ata has        7 bytes
they do not match!
```

Huh? But they look the same!?

```shell
$ wtutf -ts $PINATA1
could not punycode-convert input
total bytes:	8
 characters:	7
----------------------------------
       code point |  bytes (len) | conversion rules violated

  a:         0x61 |       61 (1) | 

$ wtutf -ts $PINATA2
   punycode:	xn--piata-pta

----------------------------------
       code point |  bytes (len)
  p:         0x70 |       70 (1) |

  t:         0x74 |       74 (1) | 
  a:         0x61 |       61 (1) |
```

Decode punycode strings

```shell
$ wtutf -p xn--piata-pta
   punycode:	xn--piata-pta
      utf-8:	pi√±ata
total bytes:	7
 characters:	6
 ```

Care is taken to avoid echoing control characters in the output

```shell
$ wtutf -trs "$(printf 'üîîbell\u07')"  
could not punycode-convert input
   total bytes:	9
    characters:	6
unicode ranges:
    Common: 2
    Latin: 4
----------------------------------
       code point |  bytes (len) | conversion rules violated
 üîî:   0x0001f514 | f09f9494 (4) | 
  b:         0x62 |       62 (1) | 
  e:         0x65 |       65 (1) | 
  l:         0x6c |       6c (1) | 
  l:         0x6c |       6c (1) | 
 ^G:         0x07 |       07 (1) | ValidateForRegistration (RFC 5891)
```

### Why make this?

I was interested in punycode and IDNA standards and wanted to make a simple utility to run locally to test conversion of various Unicode characters.

The Unicode Transformation Format ‚Äì 8-bit (UTF-8) encoding allows for some difficult to interpret strings even when your rendering environment doesn't garble the characters with question marks or boxes.

The combining characters are a good example. The usage example above shows two strings that look identical on my system: "pi√±ata" and "pinÃÉata". Only if I examine the bytes of those strings can I see that the second one uses 0x6e (n) and the UTF-8 "combining tilde" character 0x0303 ( ÃÉ) to create the Spanish e√±e. The first uses the single 0xf1 (√±) "precomposed character".

Many combining characters aren't allowed in IDN domain registrations because they would provide a way to register names that are visually indistinguishable but comprised of different bytes, making things confusing for online pi√±ata shopping. This is an example of general problem of homoglyphs in the DNS. Though combining characters are disallowed in the INDA specs, homoglyphs can still be used in various underhanded ways in and this tool could be useful to examine suspect strings.

Use the `--check`,`-c` flag to get a simple ok/caution validation of a string:

```shell
$ wtutf -c www.÷Åoo÷Ål–µ.com || echo 'WARNING'
WARNING
```

And to see a summary of the Unicode script families found in the input, use `--show-ranges`,`-r`:
```shell
$ wtutf --check --show-ranges www.÷Åoo÷Ål–µ.com
Cyrillic: 1
Latin: 9
Armenian: 2
```

```shell
$ wtutf -tr www.÷Åoo÷Ål–µ.com             
      punycode:	www.xn--ool-tdd07nca.com
   total bytes:	17
    characters:	14
unicode ranges:
    Latin: 9
    Common: 2
    Armenian: 2
    Cyrillic: 1
----------------------------------
       code point |  bytes (len)
  w:         0x77 |       77 (1) | 
  w:         0x77 |       77 (1) | 
  w:         0x77 |       77 (1) | 
  .:         0x2e |       2e (1) | 
  ÷Å:       0x0581 |     d681 (2) | 
  o:         0x6f |       6f (1) | 
  o:         0x6f |       6f (1) | 
  ÷Å:       0x0581 |     d681 (2) | 
  l:         0x6c |       6c (1) | 
  –µ:       0x0435 |     d0b5 (2) | 
  .:         0x2e |       2e (1) | 
  c:         0x63 |       63 (1) | 
  o:         0x6f |       6f (1) | 
  m:         0x6d |       6d (1) | 
  ```

The 0x0581 (÷Å) and 0x0435 (–µ) look slightly different from 'g' and 'e' on my system, but they could easily go unnoticed in many contexts.

This program shows what went into strings that look similar but aren't identical. It is also useful if you need to troubleshoot punycode conversion.
